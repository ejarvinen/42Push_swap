A program implementing bucket sort type sorting algorithm to sort a stack with a limited set of instructions and the smallest number of moves.
The program is optimized for stack sizes equal to and smaller than 500 numbers. Accepted input values should be of type `integer` and belong in the range of `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN`.

### How to run

`./push_swap 2 4 3 1 5`

### Compilation

`git clone` to desired directory. `cd` into that directory. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` in the same directory and then `make`.
